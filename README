Fedora COPR Package Scripts
===============================================================================
https://github.com/pcmoore/copr-pkg_scripts

These scripts help generate patches and SRPMs for use with Fedora's COPR build
system.  At the moment the scripts require customization for each package/COPR
and are only lightly documented; knowledge of git, bash scripting, and the
Fedora COPR build system is required to make use of these scripts.  Future
releases of these scripts will improve both on the documentation and the
usability of the scripts.
